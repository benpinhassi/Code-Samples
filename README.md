# This project contains code samples for data analysis assignments
## Two different codes have been uploaded to this project using Jupyter Notebook for writing and executing the code. There are also three CSV files used by our code within the notebooks. 
### 1. Analysis and Graphical Presentation of Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey 2022.
This data analysis capstone project aims to showcase abilities in Python, data frame management, data visualization, and drawing conclusions.

To view this project, please open 'python_capstone_project.ipynb' and extract the 'survey_results_public.csv.zip' file to the same folder as the IPYNB file.

The data was downloaded from the Kaggle site:

### 2. Monthly Liquidity Check for Accounts.
This Python code is used once a month to check for holdings that might be difficult to sell during times of low liquidity in the stock exchange.

To view this code, please open 'check_accounts.ipynb' and ensure that the two CSV files are in the same folder as the IPYNB file. The two CSV files are 'BAMARIKBAKAR010110.csv' and 'KRANOT_ITROT030007.csv'.

**Please note that any data in the Jupyter notebook and the CSV files is for demonstration purposes only and does not represent real or confidential information**
